# INU Traders

Web application to Buy, Sell, Exchange used stuff only in INU(Incheon National University).

## What is INU Traders?

INU Traders is a web application that I made as a small project which people can buy, sell, exchange their used stuff or even unused ones to save their money and time while making some great relationships with the people in INU.

## Can I use it?

Unfortunately, No.
I made this only to improve and practice my skills.
Even though you can access to it, there will be no one actually using it.
